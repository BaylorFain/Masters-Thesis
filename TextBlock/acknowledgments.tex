Studying viruses during a pandemic gives a person a different view of the effects occurring worldwide. It shows you how making your research accessible to all people is so very important. I'm truly thankful to all the doctors, nurses, educators, and researchers who worked even when at risk of becoming sick. For me specifically, I must thank my wife, Kelli, for not only helping me manage during the transition time of being only at home, but also for being a mentor of writing. I must also thank my advisor Dr. Dobrovolny, for not giving up on me even when I thought I could not continue, checking on me when I need it, and for bringing me back on track when I venture off with small details or a side project. Thank you to my mom, Sharon, for believing in me and giving me new recipes to try during the stay at home time. Thank you to my committee for agreeing to review my work, to ensure it is of the necessary quality.
