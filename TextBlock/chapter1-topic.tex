\section{Basic Virology}
Viruses are microscopic parasites, generally much smaller than bacteria, that lack the capacity to thrive and reproduce outside of a host body. 

Some viruses cause illnesses and the spread of a few has been severe enough to cause global pandemics (global outbreaks). 

In order to understand viruses, assays are performed.

\section{Modeling of assays}

In recent years, the field of virology has started using agent-based models to study the spread of viruses during \emph{in vitro} viral infection assays \citep{beauchemin_simple_2005,alvarado_cellular-level_2018,wodarz_laws_2014,tong_development_2015,whitman20,goyal16,itakura10,wasik14} in an effort to study the spatiality of viral spread, but currently the implementation of the agent-based models has had two issues: speed and size.

\section{Exigence}
While it might be feasible to wait long periods of time to run accurate simulations for endemic or recurrent seasonal viruses, recent events of the COVID-19 pandemic indicate how great a need there is for accurate and fast modeling methods.

\section{Scope}

In this work, the testing, validation, and application of a hybrid ABM and partial differential equation model (PDM) implemented on GPUs is presented.
