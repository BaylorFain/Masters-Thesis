Studying viruses during a pandemic, gives a person a different view of the affects occurring world wide. It shows you how important making your research accessible to all people is so very important. I'm truly thankful to all the doctors, nurses, educators, and researchers whom worked even when at risk of becoming sick
For me specifically, I must thank my wife, Kelli, for not only helping me manage during the transition time of being only at home, but also for being a mentor of writing. I must also thank my advisor Dr. Dobrovolny for not giving up on me even when I thought I could not continue, checking on me when I need it, and for bring me back on track when I venture off with small details or a side project. 
Thank you to my mom, Sharon, for believing in me and give me new recipe to try during the stay at home time.
Thank you to my committee for agreeing to reviewing my work, to ensure it is of the necessary quality.
